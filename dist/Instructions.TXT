Speech will only work for MAC computers/laptops with the Apple Dictation & Speech tool.
The shortcut for dictation will have to be changed to SHIFT + F3 for Speech to work.

The following software will have to be installed:

- MAMP

The following SQL script will have to be imported in PhPMyAdmin (localhost)

- sql_log.sql

The default username and password for the database will have to be
user: root
pass: root

You can change these in the source code in Constants.java if you wish.

The lib folder and it's contents may NOT be removed and will ALWAYS have to be in the same directory as Speech.jar.

If you have any trouble installing Speech, you can contact the author at shah.nami@hotmail.com


Enjoy!
